## Introduction

This is a simple time-triggered program, based on mbed OS2 for the FRDM-K64F.
It illustrates the use of a basic CAN library in loopback mode. The name
`EngineMonitor` is related to the use of the program as the starting point for
an exercise in simulating a Driver Information subsystem.
